                                    Hi, I'm Allen â€” an ESL teacher turned software engineer.
                                </p>

                                <p className='font-geneva text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300'>
                                    I have 6 years of experience teaching English to adult students from a
                                    diverse set of backgrounds and cultures, which has given me valuable skills
                                    in communication, problem-solving, and adaptability. I have always been
                                    passionate about both technology and language, and I believe that with my
                                    background in teaching I bring a unique perspective on how to approach 
                                    and solve problems in the field of software engineering.
