                    The goal of this project was to create a lightweight, efficient shell that can handle command execution, 
                    signal processing, and environment variable expansion. It's a user-friendly interface for interacting with the 
                    operating system at a more granular level, and is especially suitable for beginners looking to explore shell concepts.

                    Challenges and Learning Outcomes
                </h2>
                <p className='font-geneva text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300'>
                    Managing zombie processes and ensuring the shell didn't leave any orphaned processes was essential for both the success of the project and the survival of my development environment. 
                    This challenge led to a deeper understanding of process life cycles and improved my skills in resource management 
                    and debugging in a Unix/Linux environment.
                </p>    
                <p className='pt-4 font-geneva text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-300'>    
                    Another notable challenge was implementing signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTSTP) without affecting the shellâ€™s responsiveness 
                    and background processes. I overcame this by deep diving into Unix signal handling and process control, eventually crafting a 
                    solution that seamlessly integrated with the existing command execution framework.
